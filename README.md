1.Dark Web sites are onion based websites
What is an onion based website ?. 
Onion based websites are ones which end with .onion extension.

For example, in normal circumstances when we visit a site the link

or the domain of the site looks like “google.com”, “example.org”, “chatsoman.com”,etc.

But an interesting thing about onion based websites is their domain looks something like this 

“https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/”

And such sites are not indexed by search engines like google.

Therefore finding such a site requires a lot of time.

 

2. Not all websites are genuine on Dark Web
Where to find Dark Web links?
Dark Web links can be found on websites like “Hidden Wiki”,etc.

Such sites preserve links on their sites like a directory where you can find desired links distributed according to various categories.

 

Sites like this can help you or forum sites like Quora or Reddit can give you some more but

such links are not reliable because most either won’t work or their response time is very bad.

 

Or in case they do work they are mostly likely fake,closed or a hacker controlled domain.

Such websites aim to get you personal information or inject some zero days on your browser or

steal contents of your clipboard. Only some of the sites are truly genuine and work better.

But also finding better sites among so many bogus sites or closed sites is very time consuming.

 

3. Slow website response.

If in case you were successful in finding a website that is genuine and also filled with better people,

no fraudsters, no scammers and also where there are no hacking attempts going on in the wild.

 

The one thing that might stop you from getting a better chat experience on Dark Web is the response

time or request time on Dark Web. This is one of the major factors that affects chatting experience on Dark Web. And you can’t do anything about it.
